module RequestLogAnalyzer::Source

  # The LogParser class reads log data from a given source and uses a file format definition
  # to parse all relevent information about requests from the file. A FileFormat module should
  # be provided that contains the definitions of the lines that occur in the log data.
  #
  # De order in which lines occur is used to combine lines to a single request. If these lines
  # are mixed, requests cannot be combined properly. This can be the case if data is written to
  # the log file simultaneously by different mongrel processes. This problem is detected by the
  # parser. It will emit warnings when this occurs. LogParser supports multiple parse strategies
  # that deal differently with this problem.
